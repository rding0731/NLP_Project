This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. \n \n \n \n APR for Balance Transfers \n \n 0.0%, introductory APR for the first 15 months on balance transfers requested within 60 days of account opening.\nAfter that, your APR for those transactions and any other balance transfer requests, if we accept them, will be 13.99% to 24.99% based on your creditworthiness and other factors. This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. \n \n \n \n APR for Cash Advances \n \n 26.24%\nThis APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. \n \n \n \n Penalty APR and When it Applies \n \n 29.99% \nThis APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.\n This APR may be applied to new transactions on your account if: \n1) you make one or more late payments; or\n2) your payment is returned by your bank \nWe may also consider your creditworthiness in determining whether or not to apply the penalty APR to your Account.\nHow Long Will the Penalty APR Apply? If the Penalty APR is applied, it will apply for at least 6 months. We review your Account every 6 months after the Penalty APR is applied. The Penalty APR will continue to apply until after you have made timely payments, with no returned payments during the 6 months being reviewed. \n \n \n \n Paying Interest \n \n Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay each month your entire balance (or if you have a plan outstanding, your balance adjusted for plans) by the due date. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date. \n \n \n \n \n For Credit Card Tips from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n \n To learn more about factors to consider when applying for or using a credit card, visit the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore \n \n \n Fees \n \n \n \n Annual Membership Fee \n \n$0\n \n \n Transaction Fees \n \n Balance Transfer \n \n \nEither $5 or 3% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater. \n \n \n \n Cash Advance \n \n \nEither $5 or 3% of the amount of each cash advance, whichever is greater. \n \n \n \n Foreign Transaction \n \n \n2.7% of each transaction after conversion to US dollars. \n \n \n \n Penalty Fees \n \n Late Payment \n \n \nUp to $38 \n \n \n \n Returned Payment \n \n Up to $38 \n \n \n \n Overlimit \n \n None \n \n \n \n \n \n \n How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called \"average daily balance (including new purchases).\" \nLoss of Introductory APR: We may end your Introductory APR and apply the Penalty APR if you do not pay at least the Minimum Payment Due within 60 days after its Payment Due Date. \nThe variable penalty APR will not exceed 29.99%.\nVariable APRs for each billing period are based on the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal 2 days before the Closing Date of the billing period. The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime Rate from the previous day it was published. If the Prime Rate increases, variable APRs will increase. In that case, you may pay more interest and have a higher Minimum Payment Due. When the Prime Rate changes, the resulting changes to variable APRs take effect as of the first day of the billing period. Variable APRs are accurate as of 06/18/2017.\n \n \n TERMS AND CONDITIONS \nView the full Card Member Agreement.\n By submitting this application, you are requesting us to open an Account in your name and to issue Card(s) as you direct.

Your Card Member Agreement includes an arbitration provision, which restricts your opportunity to have claims related to the account heard in court or resolved by a jury, and to participate in a class action or similar proceeding. \nWe may change the Card Member Agreement subject to applicable law. We may do this in response to the business, legal, or competitive environment. Changes to some terms may require 45 days advance notice, and we will tell you in the notice if you have the right to reject a change. We cannot change certain terms during the first year of your Card Membership.\n Additional Cards: Additional Card Members do not have accounts with us but they can use your Account subject to the terms of the Card Member Agreement.

In some cases, it may take up to six weeks to complete a balance transfer. Please be sure to make all required payments on any account from which you are transferring a balance until the balance transfer is credited to that account.
